# Project: Dark Rally Blockchain
This project has the purpose to integrate the vehicular racing game "Dark Rally" into Blockchain technology, for which three Smart Contracts (SC). were developed:
1) DarkRallyNFT, for the minting and transfer of NFT tokens and other related transactions.
2) DarkRallySale, which handles the management of purchases of the mentioned NFTs by users.
3) DarkRallyMktPlace, which manages the Dark Rally MarketPlace where NFT owners can trade their NFT tokens.

In addition, Open Zeppelin Defender was used to automate the minting of trophies, for which the corresponding Autotask script has been developed.

For this purpose, a React front-end was developed to demonstrate the functionalities of the mentioned Smart Contracts, that includes a Shop of NFT and Administration pages.  Additionally, there is another very simple front-end to test the functionalities of a MarketPlace, which allows the owners of NFTs to offer to sell their assets at the price they want.

## Built With
- Solidity for Ethereum Smart Contracts
- JavaScript / Webpack for simple MarketPlace's front-end
- GitFlow
- Testing with Hardhat

## Live Demo
[Link to main front-end live Demo](https://dark-rally-hj4g.vercel.app/)

[Link to simple MarketPlace's front-end live Demo](https://cmolinan.github.io/DarkRallyMarketPlace/)

- Both front-end uses Testnet Polygon Mumbai and coins from our own USDC Smart Contract.
- If you wish to test these developments, you must mint coins from the USDC Contract that is also included in this repository.
- If you only want to test using the front-ends, write to this email to mint coins for you: cmolinan@gmail.com
